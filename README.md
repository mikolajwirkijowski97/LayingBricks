## Stacking Bricks

A cozy idle tower builder, that let's you build your tower high up into the sky by grinding miles on strava or apple health. The structure be built based on how many kilometers you have ran on strava/ah. Each mile is another brick towards the development of your castle. 

Z2 Runs build the brick base. Z3 builds sth else idk, Z4/Z5 add drip.
